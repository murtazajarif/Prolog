% Example Usage
% To identify potential drugs for inflammation
% Usage: identify_potential_drugs(inflammation).

% To identify potential drugs with a specific chemical feature
% Usage: identify_potential_drugs_by_feature(statin).

%Drug discovery involves the identification of potential drug candidates that can 
%effectively treat a specific disease. We have analyzed chemical structures and predicted
%their biological activities.
